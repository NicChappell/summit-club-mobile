CREATE A CONTEXT FOR THE MAPSTACK
    - the database should be openeed and stored in the context
        - the database is accessible then to all children in the stack
        - might require adding methods to the context object that are imported into the componetns
            - e.g. a function to query all features, and a function to query a single feature



Create new firebase project under nwc@nicchappell.com
    - I think firestore is going to be the solution I should go with
      instead of the realtime database
        - peak data makes more sense to store in the firestore structure
        - users and corresponding data might make sense to to use realtime database,
          but if it's too much overhead to use both I think a flatter firestore structure could work
          for use data too
    - figure out how to do a bulk import
    - use the geojson peaks github repo to upload peaks data for everything in that repo
        - start with Colorado, but organize to upload literally everything
            - collections organized from Continent > Country > State(/Province)
    - add firebase to my react native expo project
    - query firebase on successful login
        - show splash screen while waiting for data to return from server and save data into database
            - bonus points if able to get snapshots of progress
    - refactor map so that it queries from new database that's populated at time of app login
        - work toward some logic that takes zoom level into account so that it returns a max number of markers
        - limit data returned to just the basic info needed for each pin
        - can also add filters to the screen to query just 14ers or 13ers or whatever
    - feature screen will also query that database to return it's full details using the id passed as a route param



Update actions and reducers so they are modularized with corresponding types and interfaces organized together.



I'll just need to watch a tutorial for firebase auth for offline apps,
but I think what I need to do is setup the auth change listener that
either wraps the entire app somehow, or maybe just attach it to the signout
method. In the interim, I think I can move forward by just storing the uid, and
use that as the thing my app uses to check if a user is authenticated.
    - could be something like is the uid i have stored in async storage match
      the current user firebase says is logged into my app.
